 There are different variable types
 byte,short,int,long
 float,double
 boolean
 char,string

Type casting from top to bottom is called implicit casting
for example: int a=10;
             long b=a;

Type casting from bottom to top is called explicit casting. Otherwise compilation error comes which says loss of value
for example: long a = 10;
             int b = (int) a;

Remember analogy of basket and ball.
